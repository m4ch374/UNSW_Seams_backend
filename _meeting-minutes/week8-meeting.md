## **2. Discussion Points:**

### Current progress updates
- Stats helper functions moved into object methods
    - Has to be implemented with standup functions
- Email testing
    - Currently has a 5s delay time, needs to be 60s for full coverage but we have a 2min time limit to run pytests in
    - May aim for 99% coverage instead
    - Alternatively have pytests just for coverage which pass automatically
- Standup functions
    - Mostly complete, working on getting coverage up and fixing any bugs
    - Currently works in the same way as sample frontend but the ‘standup already running’ error never raises since using /standup during a standup just makes it send as a normal message.
- Notifications
    - Mostly complete, working on pytests and fixing bugs

### Deployment and pdf section

- Deploy once code is complete and working

### Bonus marks
- We already have OOP which we may be able to get bonus marks for
